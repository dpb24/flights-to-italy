# flights-to-italy

In this Jupyter notebook, we perform data exploration and analysis on a series of flights between UK and Italy. We compile the flight tracking data and summarise flight information to create additional visualisations in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.briggs6120/viz/FlightstoItaly/Dashboard1).

This project is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/davidpbriggs/notebook-flights-to-italy). The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidpbriggs/flights-to-italy) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/world-airports).
