✈️ Visualising My Flight Data in Tableau 🌍 <br>
In recent years, I’ve taken countless flights to Italy — but what does that look like when mapped out?
To find out, I used Python 🐍 to crunch some data and built a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.briggs6120/viz/FlightstoItaly/Dashboard1) revealing: <br>
 - 🕒 200+ hours in the air <br>
 - 🚀 100,000 airmiles - almost half the distance to the Moon <br>
 - 📍 4 'motorways in the sky' that connect London and Rome <br>

This project is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/davidpbriggs/notebook-flights-to-italy). The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidpbriggs/flights-to-italy) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/world-airports).
