# Flights to Italy (Python & Tableau)
### ✈️ Visualising my flight data in Tableau 🌍 <br>

In recent years, I’ve taken countless flights to Italy — but what does that look like when mapped out?
To find out, I used Python 🐍 for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing before building a Tableau dashboard.

### 💡 Key Insights: <br>
 - 🕒 **200+ hours** in the air <br>
 - 🚀 **100,000 airmiles** - almost half the distance to the Moon <br>
 - 📍 **4 'motorways in the sky'** that connect London and Rome <br>
